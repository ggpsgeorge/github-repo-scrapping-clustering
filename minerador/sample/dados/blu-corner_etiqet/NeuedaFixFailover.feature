Feature: Test client failover

    Scenario: Test failover to secondary client
        Given a "fix" client with primary config "${etiqet.directory}\etiqet-fix\src\test\resources\config\client.cfg" and secondary config "${etiqet.directory}\etiqet-fix\src\test\resources\config\secondary_client.cfg"
        When client is logged on
        And "BME" order book is purged
        Then send a "NewOrderSingle" message with "AccountType=3,ReceivedDeptID=EQ" as "order"
        And wait for an "ExecutionReport" message with "TargetSubID=DBL"
        And wait for an "ExecutionReport" message with "TargetSubID=DBL"
        Then failover
        When client is logged on
        And "BME" order book is purged
        Then send a "NewOrderSingle" message with "AccountType=3,ReceivedDeptID=EQ"
        And wait for an "ExecutionReport" message with "TargetSubID=DBL"
        And wait for an "ExecutionReport" message with "TargetSubID=DBL"
        And "BME" order book is purged
        Then stop client

    Scenario: Test named client failover to secondary client
        Given a "fix" client "myFixClient" with primary config "${etiqet.directory}\etiqet-fix\src\test\resources\config\client.cfg" and secondary config "${etiqet.directory}\etiqet-fix\src\test\resources\config\secondary_client.cfg"
        And filter out "Logon" message
        When client "myFixClient" is logged on
        And "BME" order book is purged for "myFixClient"
        Then send a "NewOrderSingle" message with "AccountType=3,ReceivedDeptID=EQ" using "myFixClient"
        Then wait for "myFixClient" to receive an "ExecutionReport"
        Then wait for "myFixClient" to receive an "ExecutionReport"
        Then failover client "myFixClient"
        Then stop client "myFixClient"

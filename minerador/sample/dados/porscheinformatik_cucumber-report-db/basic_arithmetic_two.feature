Feature: Basic Arithmetic Two

    Background: A Calculator
        Given a calculator I just turned on

    Scenario: Addition Two
    # Try to change one of the values below to provoke a failure
        When I add 4 and 5
        Then the result is 9

    Scenario: Another Addition Two
    # Try to change one of the values below to provoke a failure
        When I add 4 and 7
        Then the result is 11

    @SILK_ID_4
    Scenario Outline: Many additions
        Given the previous entries:
            | first | second | operation |
            | 1     | 1      | +         |
            | 2     | 1      | +         |
        When I press +
        And I add <a> and <b>
        And I press +
        Then the result is <c>

    Examples: Double digits
        | a  | b  | c  |
        | 10 | 20 | 35 |
        | 20 | 30 | 2  |


    @SILK_ID_5
    Scenario: Another Addition Two
  # Try to change one of the values below to provoke a failure
        When I add 4 and 7
        And I have an unimplemented step
        Then the result is 11

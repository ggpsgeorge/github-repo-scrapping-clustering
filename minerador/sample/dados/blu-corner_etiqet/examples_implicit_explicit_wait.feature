Feature: Explicit and implicit waits

    Scenario: Implicit waits
        Given I open the browser
        Given I set implicit wait to 100 nanoseconds
        Given I set implicit wait to 100 milliseconds
        Given I set implicit wait to 100 seconds

    Scenario: Explicit waits
        Given I open the browser
        Given I am waiting for elements to be present with a timeout of 10 seconds when selecting
        Given I am waiting for elements to be visible with a timeout of 10 seconds when selecting
        Given I am waiting for elements to be clickable with a timeout of 10 seconds when selecting

    Scenario: Clear explicit wait
        Given I open the browser
        Given I am waiting for elements to be present with a timeout of 10 seconds when selecting
        Then explicit wait is disabled
